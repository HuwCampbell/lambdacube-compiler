- mutual recursion (inference & reduction)

- backend: include compiler version in the generated pipeline as a string info field
- backend: generate let in shaders
- backend: array support
- backend: GLSL codegen doesn't support Vector and tuple patterns (not compiler frontend related):
          fragment02tuple
          fragment02vectorpattern

- backend: basic pipeline optimization (let-floating)

extra (language features):

- support pattern synonyms
- properly support type annotations in where blocks
- properly support record fields (in any order)

extra (dependent types):
- evalXXX not wired in compiler

- compiler:  dependent prelude should work again

extra (ambiguity checks):
- re-enable ambiguity checks
- really check type annotations
- prohibit constraints like    a ~ List a,  a ~ a -> a, etc.
- suppress univ. polymorphic ambiguity

extra (think about these):
- compiler:  recheck should not fail / coe missing?
- compiler:  (a ~ b) + (a ~ c)   --->   b ~ c        (fragment06tailrecursion)

extra (improvement):
- better persentation of types in editor tooltips
