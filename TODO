0.3  goal: start of more public development
done:
- use travis ci
- timeout for tests
- docker image: lambdacube3d/lambdacube3d
- quake map viewer application works for a sufficiently small map  +Csaba
- update online editor to use the new compiler
- tooltip testing
- compiler: ranges in error messages +Andor
- subexpression type tooltips in the editor
- pretty print Exp's defined in CoreToIR.hs
- refactored Builtins.lc

0.4  goal: usable compiler
done:
- compiler: fix looping (primes, recursivetexture01)
- refactor test system
- support simple import lists (hiding + explicit)
- support type synonyms
- better tooltip ranges & types
- tried to speedup with cache max. de bruin indices
- multiple guards
- handle constructor operator fixities, also in patterns
- small language feature tests framework
- document Hello World example on Haskell
- compiler: review parser de-brunin index handling
- automated test env. for backends

------------------------------------------------------------------- week Feb 1
-- padding week

done:
- compiler optimization: separate types and values (vs. church style lambda)
- compiler optimization: separate use of neutral terms
- compiler optimization: erease lam var type
- compiler optimization: erease univ. pol. arguments of constructors
- compiler optimization: erease univ. pol. arguments of case functions
- compiler optimization: speed up 'eval' function
- compiler put internals and prelude automaticly to include path when using compiler as a library
- use less 'try' in parser
- desugar node definitions
- definitions are allowed in any order (not just bottom-up)
- support qualified module imports
- editor: move default program to normal examle what comes from the server
- quake3: fix character animations
- quake3: basic collision test
- documentation: sync getting started description with the example source code
- documentation: update lambdacube(engine) page on haskell wiki
- better API documentation
- documentation: improve documentation with explanatory diagrams
- release 0.4 compiler on hackage

------------------------------------------------------------------- weeks Feb 8, Feb 15

0.5  goal: improvement + linear time interpretation

done:
- compiler: (~) :: forall a . a -> a -> Type
- backend: support sampler objects (opengl 3.3)
- backend: include compiler version in the generated pipeline as a string info field
- backend: support Texture2DSlot (purescript)
- editor: user texture support (no crossdomain support)
- reuse the same Exp data type in CoreToIR
- normalized variable names in the generated pipeline (so that the same structures have to be equal)
- move to megaparsec
- blog about 0.4 release
- testenv: add editor examples as backend tests
- error messages lookup in other modules' source code, not just the compiled ones
- shader pretty print (first version)
- don't overnormalize (String => [Char])
- compiler: support function recognition
- backend: generate functions in shaders
- backend: remove duplicate programs
- support local pattern matching functions
- support recursive local definitions
- testenv: performance benchmarks (time and memory consumption)
- tuples are heterogeneous lists
- names have Int identifiers
- move Quake repo to lambdacube github org
- webpage: package overview page
- webpage: feature list, screenshots
- webpage: put links to subpages for homepage
- register to stackage
- setup mailing list/forum for the community/update Q&A page (Community part) (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lambdacube3d-discuss)
- editor: highlight errors in editor
- add CHANGELOG
- pause/time input + slider on editor page
- compiler: somewhat better README: description
- remove MVP from examples
- webpage: create community page (link to the mailing list, ideas how to contribute)
- port to wl-pprint (another option was to port to pretty compact 2.0; required by stackage)
- document heterogeneous lists in language specification
- update getting started
- update overview
- editor: more visible error ranges
- update API docs
- release post about v0.5
